Mint Own NFT Collection
  .url: https://buildspace.so/p/mint-nft-collection


An NFT is a "token" that a person can own that links to some piece of "data" (ex. a link to a piece of digital art, a video, an image, etc). 
The trick with NFTs is that each "token" has a unique identifier that lets the owner prove that it's one of a kind

Smart contract has all the logic around our NFTs. They will be deployed on blockchain.
A client website that will let people easily mint NFTs from our collection.

Minting an NFT means you take a digital file and turn it into a digital asset that can be stored on the blockchain. Once it's become a 
digital asset, your NFT can be put into circulation, and it can be sold via smart contract.

Follow instructions in Project 1 to install hardhat and relevant dependencies and create a hardhat project

Install dependencies OpenZeppelin which is another library that's used a lot to develop secure smart contracts.
   .npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

Create a project with npx hardhat

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js to deploy the contract on local blockchain

Follow instruction in Project 1 to create a simple .sol, .js file and deploy it with npx hardhat
Modify the .sol file to mint NFT

OpenZeppelin implements the NFT standards and allow us to write custom logic on top of it so that we can avoid those bioler plate code

COnstruct the JSON of any kind with the standard and host it by pasting it on https://jsonkeeper.com/
Example JSON
{
	"name": "Football Shoes",
    "description": "Its noway close!",
    "image": "https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blte7f89fd9c8b78713/61163b3183a7ab110814d2d9/23f6aba730eb479e6c668e3e08501996401740c0.jpg?quality=80&format=pjpg&auto=webp&width=1000"
}
Hosted Location: https://jsonkeeper.com/b/M8B8

Setting the tokenUri with the NFT and metadata (json hosted website)
_setTokenURI(newItemId, "https://jsonkeeper.com/b/M8B8");

Follow the instruction in Project 1 to get the QuickNode URI, RinkeBy Testnet Private Key and deploy the contract
Mint the NFT with the deployed contract on actual blockchain.

Head on to https://testnets.opensea.io/?utm_source=buildspace.so&utm_medium=buildspace_project
Search for contract and we will see actual minted NFTs we just did

Here the problem is, what if the image URL we use in NFT standard JSON goes down? Also what if JSON we hosted that website goes down then
our NFT will be broken and the user who minted NFT will no longer be accessible.
THe solution is to keep NFT data on chain (on the contract itself) rather than relying on 3rd party sites.
In this way trust is also built between users because blockchain is up forever and hence our NFT will be up forever.
Many popular project use on-chain data Like Loot => https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/loot-games-the-crypto-world/?utm_source=buildspace.so&utm_medium=buildspace_project

Common way to store NFT data for images is using SVG (image built using code)
Example SVG image
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet" viewBox="0 0 350 350">
    <style>.base { fill: white; font-family: serif; font-size: 14px; }</style>
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
    <text x="50%" y="50%" class="base" dominant-baseline="middle" text-anchor="middle">EpicLordHamburger</text>
</svg>

View svg images at => https://www.svgviewer.dev/?utm_source=buildspace.so&utm_medium=buildspace_project

We want to somehow get this data in our NFT without hosting it anywhere
Take svg code and encode it in base64 (accepted standard for encoding data into a string)
Form a url like this => data:image/svg+xml;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SVG_HERE

We now have NFT image data permanent
Update the JSON file and replace the image url link with this
{
	"name": "Football Shoes",
    "description": "Its noway close!",
    "image": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SVG_HERE"
}
Besides hosting this JSON data, we will base64 this JSON data
Form a url like this => data:application/json;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSON_HERE

Here is how we now hosted our JSON data also permanently
Change the _setTokenURI and add updated JSON data url and redeploy the contract to see the changed

Now we can make changes to our contract in such a way that using solidity we generate SVG images dynamically with 3 different words
in center of a black box. Encode the string in base64 with the help of Base64.sol helper library and finally built the JSON and encode it
and set the final token URI.

A problem here is that we cannot store large images or videos in SVG formats because our contract will be so complex and will require a lot
of GAS to execute a trasacntion.
We probably use S3 bucket or GCP storage. We also has IPFS which is a distributed file system run by some strangers and trustworthy. IPFS
is considered as an industry standard to store NFT assets. We upload our NFTs and it returns back unique content hash id which we use.

We upload our files to a separate pinning service so that our files our cached and easily retrievable. Pinata is a good pinning service.
We make account on Pinata, upload our content and it will give CID value which we will append to IPFS link
Pinata => https://www.pinata.cloud/?utm_source=buildspace&utm_medium=buildspace_project
IPFS => https://decrypt.co/resources/how-to-use-ipfs-the-backbone-of-web3
Link For IPFS => https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE

We then put this IPFS link into _setTokenURI in our contract code

NFT is just a JSON file at the end of the day that links to some metadata. You can put this JSON file up on IPFS. You can also put the NFT 
data itself (ex an image, video, etc) up on IPFS.

Right now our users only have to pay gas fees to mint awesome nfts and we not getting any of that money! There are several ways to alter 
our smart contract that make the user pay to mint the transactions, such as adding payable to our contract and using require to set a 
minimum amount.
