Permissioned Blockchain is the network where a node can trasact with having certain permissions
It is also known as consortium blockchain

About Hyperledger

Hyperledger Itself is Not
  -A Cryptocurrency
  -A Blockchain
  -A Company
  
It is a project under Linux Foundation. There are many projects under Linux Foundation like Node, Linux OS etc
Linux foundation initiated the Hyperledger project to promote cross industry collaborations. The goal is to bring together stakeholders, tech providers,
developers to develop blockchain based solutions for their particular business.

In Hyperledger project there are multiple tools and frameworks available. For blockchain, one of the important framework is Hyperledger Fabric
Whenever we talk about blockchain, the first thing comes to our mind is crypcurrencies / bitcoint
But blockchain is not just about cryptocurrencies which is proved by Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are public blockchains. Everyone can see what is going one
What if some enterprise company wants to build a solution on blockchain but they dont want to show their data to everyone nor spent money for the
mining.

Here private blockchain comes into picture. Node who needs to join the network must enroll themself through MSP (Membership Service Provider)
Hyperledger Fabric is a private / permissioned business blockchain where we can create such thing as subnets between the nodes which are called 
channels in which only those nodes can see the transactions and no one else.
If One node is part 2 networks then it will contain 2 ledgers. One for Network 1 and One for Network 2

Amazing part with Fabric is that they have separated the ledger in 2 parts
  1) World State which stores the current state of the chaincode
  2) Transaction Log which holds all the history of the states of the chaincode.
  
If there is an Asset A sold by Peer X to Y who solds to peer Z then the World state holds current asset holder as peer Z and Peer X and Y will be in the
transaction Log as a history of asset A

It is designed to handle business logic just like smart contract. The smart contract code in hyperledger
is called the chaincode.
PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is the consensus algo used in hyperledger

Hyperledger prject defines several tools to develop applications
Some of the toole sare
  1) Yeoman Tool (Used to create skeleton business network)
  2) Compose Modeling (Used to define assets of business application)
  3) Compose (For Deploying application)
  
Compose tool is similar to truffle (used for dApp development)

Developing Blockchain Network

  1) Use Yeoman tool for developing business network
       .cto file contains class definition for assets, participants and transactions
	   .js file contains transaction functions
	   .acl file contains access control rules
  2) Package the entire directory using Composer Tool to package the code into a deployable business netowrk archive
       .composer sets the credentials, runs the server and deploy the appliction
	   .composer playground allows to interact with the deployed business netowrk
  3) Generate the Rest Server to interact with it.
  
Follow the Demo file for all the steps related to starting the fabric, setting the business netowrk, deploying it and interacting with it.

Augur and Grid+ are 2 dAapp platforms implemented on Ethereum
These 2 illustrates 2 very diverse uses of the blockchain

Augur is a trustless, decentralized prediction market platform based on blockchain technology
Participants can join and leave as they wish (reason for being trustless)

**Prediction markets are open markets where specific outcomes can be predicted using financial incentives.

Participants are not bound by any central authority
The market creator post a market event
Market reporters invest on the outcome of the event
Once the outcome is finalised, the participants who forecasted the outocome correctly win a payback and other lose their money

This end to end process is carried out automatically by Ethereum Smart COntract

Challenges and Solutions


Consensus means general agreement
In Blockchain, consensus is an agreement between the full nodes for the new block to be added to the chain

Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as consensus. It is computationally expensive
It is said that bitcoin consumes as much energy as a country of Ireland per day

There lies a problem, PoW use enormous energy to mine a block


Alternate to PoW

Proof Of Work (PoS)

Ethereum followed PoW with slight modifications
Ethereum Metropolis still utilises PoW memory based which is not that much energy intensive
Ethereum Constantinople uses Proof of Stake (PoS)

In PoS, the full node with most stake, most coin is chosen to add the next block
The idea is that node with most stake will not be malicious and will never risk its stake for damaging the network
To avoid monopoly by the node with most stake, an age based round robin policy is used in addition to PoS
Minter pee is paid by the transaction fee and there is no separate miner fee such as in PoW
PoS is environment firendly and effecient and adopted by many blockchain platforms


Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

Nodes vote to elect the leader and that node adds the block to the chain
It is popular in permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric

Blockchain has taken the responsibility of the intermediaries in the form of
  -Validation
  -Verification
  -Record of the transaction
  -Consensus process for the integrity of the chain
All this takes some time and a significant overhead in the confirmation of the transaction when compared to the centralized system

Every full node stores the entire chain of blocks. All these impede the scalability of the blockchain application
Scalability of a system is referred to as the ability of a system  to perform satisfactory at all practical levels of load.

The "load" in the blockchain context could be transactions, number of nodes, number of accounts etc 
We focus on transaction per second as a metric for scalability

The most obvious solution to increase transaction rate is to increase number of transactions per block
Bitcoin addresses it in 2 ways
  1) Segregated Witness (SegWit)
      .Transactions and Signatures are segregated allowing more transactions per block. This was a soft fork done in 2017
  2) Increase the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB fixed size
  
In Ethereum block size can vary and is limited by the gas limit specified in the block header
Number of transactions in a block dictates the block size

These are some of the solution related to on-chain

For improving scalability we can also refer to as
  1) Off chain scalability
  2) Sharding
  3) Parallel Processing

Privacy vs Confidentiality

Privacy refer to as the protection of data, attributes, assets from an observation of untrusted parties
Confidentiality refer to as access of data by the authorized users

Bitcoin is a public blockchain and we can see all the transactions happening there
Many blockchains are permissioned like Hyperledger Fabric. They limit access to permissioned entites only. THis ensures privacy of the network

Some of the blockchain platforms like MultiChain ensures that transacting nodes are indeed in a permissioned list
It also authenticates sender and receiver using key exchange for every transaction

For confidentiality the basic method is to encrypty the data and digitally sign it and obfuscate the data by adding extra elements (faking and secret
value addition)

Escrow and Multi Signatures

These are the 2 techniques to address business contract related issues

Escrow => An agreement between two people or organizations in which money or property is kept by a third person or organization until a particular 
condition is met

A smart contract can do this. It can hold money and artifacts and allow transacting parties to negotiate on it and verify confitions to be met
before the disbursement of the items.

We can use 3 specific features of smart contract to develop escrow based application
  1) Include escrow based amount as a state variable i.e uint escrowAmount;
  2) Use modifiers to met the conditions for the disbursment of the escrow
  3) Define the functions that apply those modifiers
  
Holding escrow commonly works in conjunction with multiple signatures which is known as Multi-Sig feature
Many real worl contracts have multi signature feature for
  1) Security
  2) Verification
  3) Protection of assets
  4) Businesses
  ...
  ...
  
A signature in the crypto world is the private key of the address. Transactions are signed by this key for the verification of the senders
authenticity
Multi-sig address in Bitcoin begins with a character 3 (Hash Example => 341xmJsl......Yt3)

Alternative Decentralized Solutions


1) IPFS (Interplanetary File System)

IPFS is a decentralized model for file transfer. The transfer is provided by the HTTP familty of protocols
HTTP is operated in a centralized hierarchical namespace

Example
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu where each item is resolved hierarchically by the DNS

Instead of identifying the resource by its location as an Http, IPFS identifies the resource by its content or by secure hash of its content
The hashes are stored in Distributed Hash Table (DHT) where a hash to location key value pair is stored

2) HashGraph

The hashgraph algorithm, is a consensus mechanism based on a virtual voting algorithm combined with the gossip protocol to achieve consensus quickly, 
fairly, efficiently, and securely. 

It aims to address one of the most intense issue in the current public blockchain, the consensus model that assures trust in decentralized system
In Ethereum Metropolis and bitcoin the consensus is achieved by PoW
The cost is quit hight for PoW

Hashgraph is a mathematical algorithm, trust model that provides a consensus layer that addresses the transaction latency, energy wasted, fairness 
and also provide computationally strong algorithm

Miner can pick any number of transaction from the mempool in any order to form a block and add that block to the blockchain. This result in the 
competition and race to solve the PoW puzzle that consumes a lot of computational power

The goal of the hashgraph is to order the transactions with low latency and minimal power consumption.

Hashgraph is an alternative to blockchain — a first generation tech with severe constraints in terms of speed, fairness, cost, and security
Hashgraph aims to provide the benefits of blockchain as a distributed ledger technology without the limitations. While many ledgers use the gossip 
protocol, Hashgraph combined the gossip protocol in the form of “gossip about gossip” with a voting algorithm to reach consensus quickly and securely 
without proof of work. The gossip protocol shares new information that other nodes don’t know, and the gossip about gossip includes where that new 
information originated.

The consensus is achieved using gossiping information about new transactions
The edges in a hashgraph are generated by gossiping of events between nodes
