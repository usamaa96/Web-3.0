Blocchain was designed to transfer peer to peer digital assets without any intermediaries
Originally created to support famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin

Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority

How bitcoin gains trust without any central authority?
By implementing programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called blockchain

What is blockchain?
It is all about 
  .Enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network
  .Establishing trust among unknown peers
  .Recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger

General brief overview of the whole process step by step
..
-Transaction is the basic element of the bitcoin blockchain
-These transactions are validated and broadcasted
-Many transactions form a block
-Many blocks form a chain through a link
-Blocks go through consensus process to be added to the chain
-Validation and consensus process carried out by special peers called 'Miners'
-Miners hold powerful computers executing the software defined by the blockchain protocol

Study About UTXOx more => https://smithandcrown.com/glossary/unspent-transaction-outputs-utxo/

Basic Operations in a blockchain network includes
  1) Validation of transactions
  2) Gathering transaction for a block
  3) Broadcasting valid transaction and block
  4) Consensus on next block creation
  5) Chaining of blocks to form a blockchain
  
There are 2 types of participants in a network
-Participants that initiate transfer of value by creating a transaaction
-Participants that take on added work and does computation to verify and broadcast the transaaction. These are called Miners.
 
Miners are rewarded with BTC for these efforts. Transaction validation is carried out by all miners independently and the process of
validation involves more than 20 criteria that includes size, syntax, etc
Some of the criterias include
  .Referenced input UTXOx are valid
  .Referenced output UTXOx are correct
  .Referenced input and output amount matched sufficiently
  
All the valid transactions are added to pool of transaactions. Miners select these unconfirmed transaactions from this pool to create a block
There is a challenge that every miner adds the block to the chain then there will be many branches of the chain resulting in an inconsitent
form of the chain. There is a solution to solve this problem and that is to compete by solving a puzzle that who will add the block to the
blockchain. Once the puzzle is solved, the announcement and the block both are broadcasted to the network notifying all the miners about it
to add the new block to their local copy. This algorithm for consensus between miners is called Proof Of Work protocol

Transaction 0 in every block in the bitcoin blockchain is for paying the miner fees. It does not have input UTXO and referred to as a coin
base transaction

Smart contract adds a layer of logic and computation to the trusted infrastructure of the blockchain

Smart contract is a piece of code deployed on a blockchain node
Execution of the Smart Contract is initiated by the message embedded in a transaction

Smart Contract written in high level programming language is translated into EVM byte code and then deployed on the EVM
Every ethereum node will host the same smart contract code

Like Bitcoin blockchain, we have UTXOs as the blokchain state.
Ethereum formally introduces the concept of 'Accounts' as a part of the protocol

Account is the originator and the target of the transaction
Transaction directly updates the account balance as to maintain the state like the bitcoin UTXO

Account types includes
  1) Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)
       .Controlled by private key
	   .It is needed to participate in the Ethereum blockchain
	   
  2) Contract Account (CA)
       .Controller by the code and can by activated by the EOA
	   .Represents a smart contract
	   
The participants in the ethereum network can send trasaction to either send ether transfer to any other peer or can also send transaction 
to invoke the smart contract code or both at the same time. Both type of transaction need fees and an account must have sufficient fees 
to send the transaaction

The fees are payed in 'Wei' which is a lower denomination of Ether
Conversion Rate Is,
   1 Eth => 10*18 Wei
   
   
Ethereum block has 
   A header
   A transaction
   Runner Up Block header
   
   
A transaction in ethereum includes
   .Reciprient of the message
   .Signature of the sender authorizing the transfer
   .Amount of Wei to transfer
   .Optional data field that contains any message to smart contract
   .StartGas which is the maximum number of computational steps the transaction is allowed
   .GasPrice which is the fee sender is willing to pay for the computation

  4) https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas
  
  
Every action in ethereum requires crypto fuel or gas
Ether value varies from market swings but Gas points do not vary

If a fee specified in Gas point in a transaaction is not sufficient then it is rejected

If an Ethereum block Gas Limit is for example 1500000 units and a plain ether transaaction takes 21,000 units then a typical ethereum
block can contain 70 transactions (1500000 / 21000)
If this block contains transaction for smart contract execution then obc this requires more gas and number of transaaction for a block will
be lower.

Gas Spent is the units used to create a particular block.

Besides winner miner, there are also other miners who solves the puzzle called Ommers and blocks created by them are called Ommer blocks.
These blocks are added as ommer blocks to the main chain. The Ommers also receive a small percentage of the total gas points

2 techniques are used to secure the chain, validation & verification
  1) Asymmetric Key encryption (Public Key Cryptography)
  2) Hashing
  
In a blockchain decentralized network
   .How do you identify the participants?
   .How do you authorize and authenticate the transaaction?
   .How do you detect forgery transactions.
All these are done by public key cryptography algorithms 

We have symmetric encryption in which the same key is used for encryption and decryption.
For example "Ceasar Encryption" in which alphabets are shifter some indexes and that shift number is referred to as the key

The symmetric encryption has 2 major issues
   1) The key is easily derivable from the encrypted message
   2) How do you pass the key to the receipant for decryption since same key is used for encrypting
   
These issues are addressed by public key cryptography where 2 individual keys are used for encrypting and decrypting mesages
The 2 individual keys are Public and Private keys where public key is obviously public and private key is kept safe

Public-Private key holds the unique quality that when the data is encryoted with private key then it can be decrypted with the
corressponding public key or vice versa

A basic example is to authenticate & authorize sender is that
  Mr.X will encrypt the message with its private key and then encrypt the message with Mr.Y's public key
  When Mr.Y receives the message, it will decrypt using its own private key and then Mr.X's public key
In this way it is ensured that only Mr.Y can open the message and the message is only to be sent by Mr.X

A popular example of Public Key Cryptography is the RSA (Rivest Shamir Adelman) Algorithm
A common example of RSA implementation is password-less user authentication like accessing VMs on amazon cloud

RSA used in most common applications, but blockchain needs more stronger algorithm 

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) family of algorithms is used in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain for generating the 
public private key pair
ECC is stronger than RSA for a given number of bits
   .256 bits of ECC key pair is equivalent to about approximately 3072 bit RSA key pair

Hashing or Hash function allows to convert an arbitrary length of input data into a unique fixed length value (mostly 256 bits)
The main hashing requirements are
   1) Should be a one way function
   2) Collision free Or exhibit a very low collision rate.
   
Common hash functions are SHA-3, SHA-256 and Keccak

2 different approaches for hashing
  1) Simple Hash
      We use simple hash when fixed number of items are to be hashed for example Block Header
  2) Merkle Tree Hash
      We use Tree Hash when number of items differ like Number of Transactions, Number of State (variable that may be mofified
	  by a smart contract execution), Number of Receipts

About Transaction Identity
..

To manage the identity of a transaction we need,
  1) Secure and Unique Account Addresses
  2) Authorization of a Transaction through Digital Signature
  3) Verification of the content of the transaction is not mofified
  
These are done by combination of Public Key Cryptography and Hashing

Generation of Account Address and Key Pair Steps

1) Private key is generated through 256 bit random number.
2) ECC cryptography is applied to that private key to obtain the public key
3) Hashing is applied to the public key to obtain the account address which is normally 160 bits or 20 bytes

The transaction sent by this account address must be
  .Authorized
  .Non Repudible
  .Unmodifiable
  
Transaction Steps

1) Find the hash of the data fields of the transaction
2) Encrypt the Hash using the private key of the initiator, thus digitally signing the transaction and making the transaction 
   non-repudiable
3) Add the encrypted data to the transaction so that others can decrypt using sender's public key
4) Send the transaction
5) Verifier will decrypt the data received in a transaction using sender's public key and take out transaction hash
6) Recompute the transaction hash and compare the hash calculated with the hash received as a digital signature
7) Accept the transaction if both hashes match

Complete transaction verification includes,
  .Account Balance
  .Nonce
  .Sufficieny of Fees
  .Timestamp

Establishing trust in blockchain
  -Secure chain using protocols
  -Validate transactions & blocks
  -Verify availibility of resources
  -Executing and COnfirming transactions
  
The Tust Trail Steps

Step 1 involves valdiating the transaction
Step 2 invlolves verify enough gas and resources

Bitcoin BLockchain involves around 20 different criterias that are checked before transaction is validated
In Ethereum, following things are validated before execution
   -Syntax, Transaction Signature, Hash, Gas, Timestamp, Nonce, Sender Account Balance, 
    Fuel/Gas points for smart contract execution
	
Step 3 involves execution of transaction

Merkle Tree Hash of the validated transaction is computed. This is for Ethereum
All miners execute the transaction for ether transfer as well as for smart contract execution

Step 4 involves Consensus Protocol

Every valid block added, builts more trust into the chain. Miners compete to add their block to the chain
What if every miner want to add their candidate block to the chain?

Proof Of Work is a consensus protocol which is used to choose the next block into the chain
It is used by bitcoin and current version of ethereum blockchain
The protocol is same but the implementations in these 2 blockchain will be different
PoW uses hashing

PoW from the perspective of miner,
Firstly, calculate the hash of the block header which is a fixed value and a nonce which is a variable
If the hash value is less than 2^128 for bitcoin and less than function of difficulty (F(Diff)) for ethereum,
then the puzzle is solved
If the condition is not satisfied then change the nonce value and repeat the process

If the puzzle is solved, broadcast the block which will be verified by other miners. Non winning miners will add the new block
to their local copy of the chain. The winner will get incentive for creating the block
